# StaX

This repository contains code originally imported from the bea-stax 1.2.0
sources from fedora. No upstream repository seems to exist any longer. 

Files and patches that are used for RPM packaging in fedora have been added on
top. Additionally, the project has been ported from `ant` to `maven`, while
preserving the structure and contents of the generated `JAR` files, if
possible.

According to the [last release][stax-src-1.2.0] uploaded to the Maven Central
Repository, the project is licensed under the terms of the Apache-2.0 license.
